### Verbs of intent

| Verb                                          | Component                            | Capability (project-plan.md)             |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Register a new user with email and password  | SignupForm + SubmitButton (143:2443) | "User registration with email and password" |

### Observations

- Form classified as Server-connected as a unit (skill rule: forms with local validation + server submit are always Server-connected); SubmitButton is also marked Server-connected because the submit action is dispatched by it (TD-05).
- The capabilities "Automatic creation of the user's channel from the email prefix" and "Account confirmation via email with an activation link" are server-side side effects of the signup mutation; they have no dedicated affordance on this screen.
- The "Sign in" link in AuthFooter and the back-arrow at the top depend on framework-provided client-side navigation (Next.js `<Link>`) — Local-interactive per skill rules.
- Visibility toggles and the strength meter operate only on client-side input.
- "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" links point to routes out of scope for Phase 02 — flagged in Open questions.
- No component visible in the screenshot is missing from `get_design_context`.

| Component (Figma node)                       | Type              | In DS? | Reuse?                                  | Notes |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| LoginForm (143:2265)                         | Server-connected  | ✗      | `components/auth/login-form.tsx (new)`  | react-hook-form + Zod (TD-04); submits → `/api/auth/login` (TD-05) |

| StreamtubeIcon (I2387:2244;2417:133)         | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/icons/streamtube-icon.tsx`  | BrandLogo sub-component |
| Heading "Sign in" (143:2273)                 | Presentational    | ✗      | new                                     | Plain-DOM `<h1>` |
| FormLabel "Email address" (2172:253)         | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/ui/label.tsx`               | — |
| Input email (147:536)                        | Local-interactive | ✓      | `components/ui/input.tsx`               | Controlled via react-hook-form (TD-04) |
| FormLabel "Password" (2172:263)              | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/ui/label.tsx`               | — |
| Link "Forgot password?" (147:539)            | Local-interactive | ✗      | new                                     | Client-side nav → `/forgot-password` (Next.js `<Link>`) |
| Input password (147:540)                     | Local-interactive | ✓      | `components/ui/input.tsx`               | Controlled via react-hook-form (TD-04); no visibility toggle in Figma |
| SubmitButton "Sign in" (147:541)             | Server-connected  | ✓      | `components/ui/button.tsx`              | Submit trigger; mutation pathway TD-05 |
| AuthFooter (2394:2271)                       | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/auth/auth-footer.tsx`       | see screen: Signup screen; internal "Sign up" link → /signup (client-side nav) |

### Verbs of intent

| Verb                                                     | Component                              | Capability (project-plan.md)            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Authenticate the user with email and password and start a session | LoginForm + SubmitButton (147:541)     | "Login and user session control" |

### Observations

- Form and SubmitButton together carry out the single server-connected verb; the verbs table has 1 row because both contribute to the same submit intent.
- Input password (147:540) has no visibility toggle in Figma — classified as Local-interactive solely due to state ownership via react-hook-form. Possible design gap.
- The "Forgot password?" link navigates to `/forgot-password` (screen #3 inventoried in this phase).
- The "Sign up" link in AuthFooter navigates to `/signup` (screen #1 inventoried in this phase).
- No error/feedback surface (inline field error, form-level alert, loading state) is present in the Figma node — flagged as a design gap; runtime states will need to be inferred during implementation or sourced from a separate Figma variant.
- StreamtubeIcon renders in Figma as an `<img>` pointing to a remote asset, but the filesystem snapshot has `components/icons/streamtube-icon.tsx` as the canonical DS component — reuse the DS component, not the asset.

## Screen: Password recovery request screen

**Route:** `/forgot-password`
**Figma:** https://www.figma.com/design/Doz7n3FsRhfvelYrPhTZAG/?node-id=140-289 (node `Doz7n3FsRhfvelYrPhTZAG:140:289`)
**Purpose (from project-plan.md):** "Password recovery: request via email → link with token → reset" — this screen covers the request step (sending the link by email).

### Component inventory

| Component (Figma node)                | Type              | In DS? | Reuse?                                      | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| ForgotPasswordForm (140:289 wrapper)  | Server-connected  | ✗      | `components/auth/forgot-password-form.tsx (new)` | Email field group + Button; submits → `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` (TD-05) |
| Card (143:2308)                       | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/ui/card.tsx`                    | see screen: Signup screen |
| arrow_back (143:2343)                 | Local-interactive | ✗      | `components/ui/icon-button.tsx (new)`       | Client-side nav back to `/login` |
| BrandLogo (2387:2252)                 | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/auth/brand-logo.tsx`            | see screen: Signup screen |
| Heading "Reset password" (143:2347)   | Presentational    | ✗      | new                                         | Plain-DOM `<h1>` |
| Helper text (143:2353)                | Presentational    | ✗      | new                                         | Plain-DOM `<p>` ("Enter your email and we'll send you a reset link") |
| EmailField group (2713:2086)          | Presentational    | ✗      | new                                         | FormLabel + Input composition |
| FormLabel "Email address" (2172:282)  | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/ui/label.tsx`                   | — |
| Input email (143:2351)                | Local-interactive | ✓      | `components/ui/input.tsx`                   | Controlled via react-hook-form (TD-04) |
| SubmitButton "Send reset link" (143:2354) | Server-connected | ✓     | `components/ui/button.tsx`                  | Triggers submit → `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` (TD-05) |
| AuthFooter (2394:2276)                | Presentational    | ✓      | `components/auth/auth-footer.tsx`           | see screen: Signup screen; the text shown in Figma is "Sign up" (likely inconsistency — "Sign in" expected) |

### Verbs of intent

| Verb                                                              | Component                                          | Capability (project-plan.md)                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Request an email with a password reset link        | ForgotPasswordForm + SubmitButton (143:2354)       | "Password recovery: request via email → link with token → reset"                 |

### Observations

- Form normalized as ForgotPasswordForm (Server-connected as a unit) for consistency with signup/login; submit state unifies EmailField + SubmitButton.
- The screen's AuthFooter shows a link labeled "Sign up" in Figma where the usual UX would be "Sign in" (back to login). Treated as a design inconsistency — flagged in Open questions.
- The success state is displayed inline on this same screen (no dedicated "check your email" route), per the decision recorded in the progress file. The success-state rendering is not present as a separate variant in Figma — only the form's default state was extracted.
- **Figma gap:** the "set new password" screen (destination of the link sent by email, where the user sets the new password) does not exist in the current Figma file. The "Password recovery…" capability is only partially covered by the design — the reset step needs to be designed before it can be inventoried.
- The `arrow_back` icon (143:2343) corresponds to the design system's "Icon button" Figma component, but there is no equivalent React wrapper in `components/ui/`; emitted as `components/ui/icon-button.tsx (new)` for `phase-b.md` § B2.6 to generate the bootstrap SI.

| "Logout"                                                                           | — (no UI in this phase)                  | — (no screen; see Open questions)                     |
| "Password recovery: request via email → link with token → reset"      | ForgotPasswordForm + SubmitButton (partial — request only) | /forgot-password (set-new-password missing from Figma) |
| "Registration, login, account confirmation, and password recovery screens"            | Signup + login + forgot-password screens      | /signup, /login, /forgot-password (confirmation de-scoped) |

## Open questions

- The "Account confirmation via email with an activation link" capability has no inventoried screen — de-scoped by the user on 2026-05-14 ("we won't implement the rest right now"). The end-to-end registration flow depends on this screen to close (after signup → email with link → confirmation screen); it will need to be picked up in a later phase. TD-07 (Email-Link Landing Pattern) anticipates an RSC processing the token server-side; recommend generating the screen's inventory before implementation.
- The "Logout" capability has no UI inventoried in this phase. The logout "screen" is, in practice, a button within the authenticated chrome (avatar/menu); its location depends on later phases that introduce the chrome (likely Phase 04 — "Management dashboard" / authenticated chrome). Confirm with `plan-validate` whether logout is intentionally out of scope for this phase.
- The password reset screen (set new password — destination of the link sent by email) does NOT exist in the current Figma file. The "Password recovery…" capability is only partially covered; the reset step needs to be designed (new Figma node) and inventoried before implementing the full flow. Until then, `/forgot-password` sends the email but the link's destination is a nonexistent route.
- Signup screen: the "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" links (node 143:2439) point to routes (`/terms`, `/privacy`) out of scope for Phase 02. Decide whether to: (a) render them as inert/placeholder links until the routes exist; (b) open an issue to create minimal static pages; (c) some other strategy.
- Signup screen + Login screen: no form-level error/feedback surface (post-submit alert, loading state, inline field errors) is present in Figma. TD-04 + the `{ statusCode, error, message }` envelope (phase-02-auth/TD-07) imply these states need to be displayed. Decide whether to: (a) infer the design during implementation following the shadcn `FormMessage` + `Alert` pattern; (b) request error/loading variants from the designer before implementation.
- Forgot-password screen: AuthFooter shows a "Sign up" link in Figma, but the usual UX for a recovery screen would be "Sign in" (back to login). Confirm with the designer which link/text is correct; fallback: implement as "Sign in" based on common UX.
- Forgot-password screen: the inline success state (after submit) was not extracted as a separate Figma variant. The design needs a success-state variant OR the implementation infers the style (confirmation box within the same Card).
- Planned-but-nonexistent components detected (`Reuse?` with the ` (new)` suffix), which will trigger `phase-b.md` § B2.6 (bootstrap SI synthesis): `components/auth/signup-form.tsx`, `components/auth/login-form.tsx`, `components/auth/forgot-password-form.tsx`, `components/auth/back-link.tsx`, `components/auth/password-visibility-toggle.tsx`, `components/auth/password-strength-meter.tsx`, `components/auth/terms-checkbox.tsx`, `components/ui/checkbox.tsx`, `components/ui/icon-button.tsx`. Confirm with `plan-build` whether all of these will be materialized in this phase OR deferred to later phases per decision.
