## Screens removed as out-of-scope

- ~~Account confirmation screen~~ — user: "we won't implement the rest right now" (scope reduced by the user on 2026-05-14)
- ~~Password reset screen (new password input after link)~~ — no design in Figma; incomplete flow (user request: "password reset screen" mapped to the request screen, which is the only one that exists)

## Decisions log

- ✓ [DECISION: Intermediate "check your email" screen after forgot-password?] — resolved: no (inline success)
- ✓ [DECISION: Intermediate "check your email" screen after signup?] — resolved: no (redirects to login with a message)
- ✓ [DECISION: Are the confirmation screen's success/error variants distinct nodes?] — resolved: confirmation screen removed from scope
