# phase-01-configuracao-base — Context

## Scope

**Phase name:** Phase 01 — Base Project Configuration

**Capabilities**

- Repository with a monorepo structure (frontend and backend)
- Next.js project (frontend) (to be created later, not now) and Nest.js project (backend) initialized
- Local development environment with all services via Docker Compose
- Initial PostgreSQL database structure (schema, migrations, and seeds) (no tables yet)
- AI foundation for coding.

**Out of scope:** All runtime features that depend on entities (auth, uploads, comments, etc.) — they start in Phase 02+.

**Deliverables:** functional development environment, configured database.

**Affected subprojects:** `nestjs-project/`

**Deferred subprojects:** `next-frontend/` — not initialized in this phase.

**Sequencing notes:** This is the first phase; no prior phase to depend on.

**Neighbors (for boundary detection only):** Phase 02 — Registration, Login, and Account Management.

## Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.

**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.

**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

## Testing Requirements

Refer to the `testing-guide-nestjs-project` Skill for layer requirements per artifact type in `nestjs-project/`. Phase 01 produces no application-layer code that warrants new unit tests; AppModule wiring and DataSource bootstrap are validated by the existing E2E test (`test/app.e2e-spec.ts`).
